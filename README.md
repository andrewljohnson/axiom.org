# The axiom.org website

This repository contains the source code for the axiom.org website. It's a static site,
generated with Gatsby and hosted on GitHub Pages.

If you make changes, you can test them locally with:

```
npm start
```

To deploy changes to the live website, run:

```
npm run deploy
```

To make this work cleanly with GitHub Pages, the deployed code goes into the separate [axiom-org.github.io repository](https://github.com/axiom-org/axiom-org.github.io). So you can see the generated code that's running on the live site there.
