Axiom is a platform for building decentralized
applications. It is also a cryptocurrency. If you've used
application platforms like Heroku or App Engine before,
you'll find parts of this familiar. If you've developed an
application using other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum
before, you'll find different parts of this familiar.

Currently, Axiom primarily targets web applications built
in JavaScript. If you know how to make a simple website,
you'll be able to deploy a simple decentralized site. To
build a more complicated application, you'll probably want
to be familiar with a JavaScript framework like React or
Vue.

The best way to learn about the Axiom system is
to build a simple application on it. The "Getting Started"
section of this documentation will explain how to get an account set up, how to deploy
a simple static site to Axiom, and then how to build a
slightly more complicated application. If you're
interested in learning more, the later sections will go
into more detail.

Good luck!
