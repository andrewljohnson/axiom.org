```bash
axiom generate
```

This command generates a keypair file containing both private key and
public key that correspond to a passphrase. You don't need this just
to use the CLI, but you will need this keypair file in order to run
your own hosting server. If you're interested in running your own
hosting server, check out the [instructions
here](https://github.com/axiom-org/axiom/tree/master/testnet).
