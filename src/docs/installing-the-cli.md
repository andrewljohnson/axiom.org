There are several different ways to interact with Axiom.
Servers running the Axiom blockchain and hosting Axiom
files interact with each other through the wire protocol.
Application code typically interacts with Axiom through
the JavaScript Axiom client. During the development
process, the most convenient way to interact with Axiom is
typically through the CLI.

You can install the CLI using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
npm install -g axiom-cli
```

```bash
yarn global add axiom-cli
```
