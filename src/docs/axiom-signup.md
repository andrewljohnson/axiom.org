```bash
axiom signup
```

During the developer beta, we are giving away currency so that people
can build applications on the system. This command is how you
collect. First, sign up for the
[newsletter](https://axiom.org/newsletter). Then, run this
command. You will have to enter a token that gets emailed to you, and
then you will have an account set up with enough currency to build an
application.

Maybe it's a little tacky to make you sign up for the newsletter to
try this out. Sorry! At least it makes it a little harder for spammers
to take up all the capacity in the system.

Speaking of spammers... when we launch the main net, we plan to keep running applications
operational and transfer them from the testnet to the main net. But
we don't plan to keep account balances in place. So there's no point in
spamming this system to get hundreds of developer accounts. The only
thing this currency is getting you is capacity on the development
system.
