```bash
axiom get-buckets [owner=<id>] [provider=<id>]
```

Shows which buckets match a query. You can either find buckets owned by a particular
user, or buckets that are being hosted by a particular provider.

If you don't provide any arguments, this command will show you all buckets that you own.
